# 🏥 Hospital Patient Monitoring System (HPMS)

A real-time distributed system for continuous monitoring of patient vitals, alert generation, and clinical coordination across hospital wards. The system is designed to improve response time to patient deterioration, reduce manual monitoring overhead, and support data-driven clinical decision-making.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Patient Monitoring System (HPMS) enables healthcare professionals to:

- Continuously monitor patient vital signs in real time
- Receive immediate alerts when readings exceed safe thresholds
- Access patient history and trend data for clinical assessment
- Coordinate care across doctors, nurses, and administrative staff
- Maintain secure, role-based access to sensitive medical data

The system prioritises **patient safety, system reliability, and clinical efficiency** under high-load hospital environments.

## 🚀 Core System Capabilities

Once implemented, HPMS will provide:

- 📡 **Real-time Monitoring** — Live tracking of vital signs using WebSocket communication
- 🚨 **Smart Alerting System** — Multi-level alerts (warning/critical) based on configurable thresholds
- 📊 **Clinical Dashboard** — Role-based dashboards tailored for nurses, doctors, and admins
- 🔐 **Secure Access Control** — JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions
- 🧾 **Patient History Tracking** — Time-series storage of patient vitals for trend analysis
- 🏥 **Hospital Integration Ready** — Designed for interoperability with EHR systems

## 🧑‍⚕️ System Roles

- **Doctors** → Monitor patients, review history, adjust thresholds
- **Nurses** → Record vitals, respond to alerts, monitor wards
- **Administrators** → Manage users, system configuration, access control
- **Technicians** → Maintain system infrastructure and sensor reliability
- **Patients (Read-only)** → View personal health data (if enabled)
